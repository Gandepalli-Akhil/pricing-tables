# pricing-tables
Built a pricing table UI using pure HTML and CSS, focusing on clean structure, Flexbox layout, and subtle hover interactions. This project strengthened my frontend fundamentals, improved my understanding of spacing and UI hierarchy, and reinforced the importance of writing clean, maintainable code.
